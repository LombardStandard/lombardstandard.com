  "about-section-1": "Buying and selling investment-grade Commercial Real Estate (CRE) is a complex legacy business where things have been done the same way for centuries: personal relationships. Then, over the last 3 decades, software technology disrupted the process with wide adoption of digital spreadsheets (early '90s) and online CRE marketplaces (around year 2000), providing a new inflow of opportunities. However, despite the long-proven business model, CRE marketplaces never thrived outside the United States.",
  "about-section-2": "In Europe or Asia Pacific, there is no unified set of rules, nor a common language and, interestingly enough, confidentiality is still considered a very important value for a deal, no matter how big. So there are no comprehensive platforms, but just local versions with limited  adoption and functionalities. The result is that the majority of CRE buyers or sellers worldwide still relies on relationships and spreadsheets to find a match, producing inefficiencies and siloes that it's time to solve.",
  "about-section-3": "<strong>Technology.</strong> The availability of Artificial Intelligence provides to any enterprise a level of computational power unimaginable just a few months ago.
